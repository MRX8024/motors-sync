# Welcome to the stepper motor synchronization project for 4wd 3D printers

## About the project

### Currently the program supports the following kinematics: `CoreXY` `4 WD`

The synchronization method involves measuring shocks when the second stepper motor, located on the same belt, is turned on. The impacts are measured by an accelerometer permanently located on the print head, depending on the type of kinematics.

### Further [instructions](/wiki/chopper_synchronization_guide_en.md), good luck!
