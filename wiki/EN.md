# Welcome to the stepper motor synchronization project for 4wd 3D printers

## About the project

### Currently the program supports the following kinematics: `CoreXY` `4 WD`

The synchronization method consists of connecting shocks when turning on the second stepper, located on one belt. The impacts are measured by an accelerometer, remaining fixed on the print head, depending on the type of kinematics.

### Further [instructions](/wiki/chopper_synchronization_guide_en.md), good luck!
